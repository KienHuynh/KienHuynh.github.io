Shawn got lost in the wood. 
He was visiting a friend – who is living like a hermit – and went off-track. 
Now he doesn’t know where he is. GPS shows that he’s in the middle of nowhere, 
and the cellular service only has one bar so he can’t make a call. 
The best Shawn could do right now is tell his friend where he is by sending a text message. 
Luckily, the friend owns the land, and he marks every tree with a unique number because 
this friend is a bit obsessive when it comes to things he owns.

Our guy moves to the nearest tree and sends its number to the friend. 
Now all he can do is wait. 
But Shawn is easily bored so he started to make up related geometry problems to solve in the meantime. 
He started thinking about how the trees can be viewed as disks from above, 
and at any point in the forest he can quickly identify all of the trees he sees by just taking a quick glance:
