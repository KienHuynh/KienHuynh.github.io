Whether it's the pristine feeling of the surrounding wood, the crisp footsteps over twigs, 
or the occasional sounds of a creek, one must admit there is something truly special to the nature of the East Coast.
Although not an avid traveler myself, I have spent quite a few trips on some famous destinations around here.
All of them have treated me quite well, but a few places still stick out though.
What exactly is it about them that makes me hold them in such high regards?

Four years ago I went to the [**Adirondack Wilderness area**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adirondack_Park) one week after peak fall season, 
what surprised me the most was the amount of cars with a Canadian license plate.
"Holy crap the Canadians must love this place a lot," I thought that was funny.
But we can trust the Canadians on this one because if you visit this place once you would love it too.

Near the mountain ranges is a cute little town that attracts a lot of people, [**Lake Placid**](https://www.lakeplacid.com/).
The town is surrounded by beautiful lakes and mountains.
There were a lot of tourists, but the crowd didn't really drain the charm away.
Lakes aren't a rarity in the United States, but the moment the town has a <i>lake</i> in its name, you know its lakes should be damn spectacular.
And they are.

On the first day after arrival, my friends and I kickstarted the trip with the hardest trail to the tallest mountain in New York, [**Mount Marcy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Marcy).
This one took us around 9 hours to finish and it tested our endurance to the limit.
Unfortunately, everywhere was hazy on that day so the colors were more subdued.
The hike was fun overall. But I wouldn't recommend it if you are a beginner.
You also need to have good telephoto lens to take better pictures.

One place that we had to rush to the top is [**Mount Jo**](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/new-york/mount-jo-loop-trail), all because we didn't want to miss the golden hour.
I was very happy that we arrived just in time for the sun to dip behind the back of the far mountains.
Witnessing the sun slowly dimming and its rays casting shadows over gigantic shapes of the earth left me speechless.
This is one of those moments which I will remember for the rest of my life.

The next place I will talk about is [**Acadia National Park**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acadia_National_Park).
Please look forward to it.
