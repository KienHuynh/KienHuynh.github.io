I am currently a CS PhD candidate at Stony Brook University, NY. 
My advisor is Professor Joseph S. B. Mitchell and 
my research interests include Computational Geometry, Combinatorial Geometry, Discrete Optimization.


I got my CS BSc and MSc degrees at Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology, Vietnam. 
Before switching to Geometry, my main line of research was Computer Vision.
I was also a lecturer at [Vietai](https://vietai.org/).
